Scala implementation of Histogrammar
====================================

See [histogrammar.org](http://histogrammar.org) for a complete introduction to Histogrammar.

This is a Scala implementation for Scala version 2.10.

**FIXME:** add tests (and check implementation) for Scala 2.11.

Installation
============

Histogrammar has a standard Maven POM. With Maven 3+, run

```bash
mvn install
```

in the base directory (to compile everything) or one of the subdirectories. All subdirectories depend on `core`, so this must be installed first.

Status
======

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/histogrammar/histogrammar-scala.svg)

The tests are pretty good, though not as thorough as [histogrammar-python](https://github.com/histogrammar/histogrammar-python).

Primitive implementation is mature. All primitives except `UntypedLabel` preserve type information in the Scala REPL, so you can extract values or tab-complete without casting.
